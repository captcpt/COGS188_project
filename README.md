## Final Project for COGS188: Artificial Intelligence Algorithms

This is a project conducted for COGS188 at UCSD, SP24.

*"This class will cover a broad spectrum of machine learning algorithms. It builds on studentsâ€™ previous exposure to machine learning. It covers new artificial intelligence algorithms ranging from topic models as used in the text data analysis to genetic algorithms."*

### Overview:

This project focuses on the integration of Q-learning, a reinforcement learning technique, with ARIMA, a time-series forecasting method, to develop an optimized trading strategy for stocks. The objective of this is to be able to dynamically adjust portfolio allocations across a number of stocks based on historical price and predictive analysis. For this project, we focused on AAPL(Apple Inc.), MSFT(Microsoft Corporation), and GOOGL(Google) stocks. Results are visualized through actual vs. predicted price comparisons and evaluated based on portfolio performance metrics and action recommendations. This approach aims to optimize portfolio value by adapting to changing market conditions and historical trends. This research demonstrates the potential of combining machine learning with statistical modeling in financial markets, offering insights into effective algorithmic trading strategies and avenues for future enhancements and refinements.
